This dataset is from the popular Indian TV show Shark Tank, where entrepreneurs introduce their companies to raise funds by offering equity to investors. Investors then show interest in businesses they find impressive and invest either individually or as part of a group. I gathered this dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-india), which contains about 43 columns. The data was initially uncleaned, with many null values and inconsistencies that I addressed before starting the analysis. The amounts in the dataset are in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) in lakhs, which I converted to millions for better understanding.

I performed this analysis using MySQL and PowerBI. By using this dataset, we aim to help entrepreneurs or future participants understand how much equity they should offer and how much funding to request to secure a deal. This analysis also covers the popular industries where the sharks have shown interest over the three seasons, and more.
