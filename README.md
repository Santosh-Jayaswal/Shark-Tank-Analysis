This dataset is sourced from the popular Indian TV show "Shark Tank," where entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to secure funding by offering equity to investors. Investors, or "sharks," then choose to invest either individually or as a group based on the pitches they find compelling. The dataset, available on Kaggle, comprises about 43 columns and was initially uncleaned with many null values and inconsistencies. I cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python (Pandas and Numpy), exporting it in CSV format to work with both SQL and PowerBI.

**Note: The amounts in the dataset are in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) in lakhs, which I converted to millions for easier interpretation.**

I conducted this analysis using MySQL and PowerBI. The goal is to assist entrepreneurs and future participants in understanding the appropriate amount of equity to offer and the funding to request to secure a deal. The analysis also highlights the popular industries that have attracted investment interest over the three seasons, among other insights.
