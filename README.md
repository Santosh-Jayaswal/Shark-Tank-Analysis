# Shark-Tank-Analysis

This is dataset of popular TV shows in India named Shark Tank where entreprenurs come to introduce their company for raising funds against they offer equity to investors and investors shows their interest to the business they are impressed and invest funds as a individual or in group of investors. I have gathered this datast from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-india) which contains about 43 columns and the data is uncleaned as there are lots of null values and inconsistencies which I prepared before jump into analysis. This values (amounts) are in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) in lakhs which I convert them million for better understanding. 

Moreover, this analysis I performed using MySQL and PowerBI. Using this dataset we are going to help the entreprenures or future participants to understand the how much equity they shold offer and ask funds in order to crack the deal. This analysis also help them to comprehand the popular industry where sharks shown interest over the period of three seasons, and so on.
